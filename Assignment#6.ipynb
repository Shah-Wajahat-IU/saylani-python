    "### 1:Re-useability:\n",
    "        Re using Some Facility rather than building again and again.This is use done with the use of class. We can use it 'n' number of time or as per our need.\n",
    "### 2:Code Maintenance:\n",
    "        This feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into it.\n",
    "### 3:Security:\n",
    "        With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to exposure which means we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.\n",
    "### 4:Design Benefits:\n",
    "        If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and fixing things easily and eliminating the risks (if any). Here the Object Oriented Programs forces the designers to have a longer and extensive design phase, which results in better designs and fewer flaws.\n",
    "### 5:Problems solving\n",
    "        Decomposing a complex problem into smaller chunks or discrete components is a good practice. OOP is specialized in this behavior, as it breaks down your software code into bite-sized â€“ one object at a time. "
